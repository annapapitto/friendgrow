# friendgrow

Inspired by [Kunal's friendlog](https://github.com/marwahaha/friendlog).

### TODOs - anyone can feel free to help with these!

- Fill out this readme with an introduction
- When recording a visit, an option to automatically update frequency to match the gap before last visit
- When friend not found, suggest similar names from DB
- List by last visited, to see what has been recorded already
